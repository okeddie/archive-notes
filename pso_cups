1. Open system-config-printer in fedora and change the Server > Settings > check “Allow printing from the internet”

2. You can add printer from network and put in path at windows pc:

http://{computername}:631/printers/{printername}

http://192.168.0.3:631/printers/deskjet_2600

I verified with tcpdump against port that windows made the connection. then just browsed through the HP driver listing for deskjet D2600 series. SMH
